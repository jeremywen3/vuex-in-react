# Thanks

- This project was scaffolded from: <https://github.com/beeman/template-typescript-package>
- Core logic is forked from: <https://github.com/dennybiasiolli/react-vuex>

## Why to fork

- Typescript for betting typings
- Use modern React syntax like context, hook
- Provide `connectGetter`
- Bug fixes (search bug fix keyword in source code)
- Potential performance boost (to be finished)

## How to run demo

```bash
//root folder
npm link

// demo folder
npm link vuex-in-react

//then
npm start
```
